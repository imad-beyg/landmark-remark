# Landmark Remark

This application allows users to save location based notes on a map. These notes can be
displayed on the map where they were saved and viewed by the user that created the
note as well as other users of the application. The application demonstrates the
functionality captured in the following user stories:

1.  As a user (of the application) I can see my current location on a map
2.  As a user I can save a short note at my current location
3.  As a user I can see notes that I have saved at the location they were saved on the map
4.  As a user I can see the location, text, and user-name of notes other users have saved
5.  As a user I have the ability to search for a note based on contained text or username
